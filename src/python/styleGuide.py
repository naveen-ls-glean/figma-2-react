TYPESCRIPT_STYLE_GUIDE = '''
Here is the style guide you must follow while writing the code:

Syntax:
Syntax must adhere to javascript Standard style.
We have some light customizations atop Standard (such as requiring trailing commas).

Naming:
Case conventions are enforced by Standard. But Naming goes much deeper and is one of the most important keys to an understandable code base. We recommend this Naming Cheatsheet. 
Particularly:
   1) Short-Intuitive-Descriptive
   2) Avoid contractions
   3) Avoid context duplication
   4) Function naming pattern (e.g. should, get, set, handle)
   5) Variable naming prefixes (e.g. is, has, should)
   6) Singular and plurals
   7) CamelCase for types, components, variables, functions, etc... For variables, the first letter should be lowercase.
